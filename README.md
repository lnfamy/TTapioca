<b> This project was made for the Weizzman Institute of Science: Computer Science - Academia and Industry student excellence program, 2018. </b> <br>
The direct inspiration for my project is Nitrome's Rust Bucket.

1. <b> Some help and inspiration for my project have been the following YouTube creators</b>:<br>
  1.a. <b>Brackeys</b> - Collectibles logic. <br>
  1.b. <b>quill18creates</b> - TileMap logic. <br>
  1.c. <b>Sebastian Lague</b> - Pathfinding logic. <br>

2. <b> Technical details</b>: 
  4.a. This project was made using Unity Editor (personal edition) versions 2017.1 to 2017.3.1f1.
  4.b. Everything here is written in C# (disregarding what little use I've made of coroutines in C++).

<b> Attached below is gameplay footage. </b>
