Hi there! I uploaded this project to GitHub for backup and optimization purposes. 
<br>Since it's public, you can use it for your own work and learn from it. However, do mind a few things:

1. <b> I am no professional (a). </b> Most complex codes from my project have either taken me a whole
lot of planning and theorizing or have been adapted to my purposes from tutorials on YouTube by the following YouTubers:<br>
  1.a. <b>Brackeys</b><br> - for collectibles logic.
  1.b. <b>quill18creates</b><br> - for most of my TileMap logic.
  1.c. <b>Sebastian Lague</b><br> - for most of my pathfinding logic.
  
2. <b> I am no professional (b). </b> Another disclaimer I must add as a... sub-disclaimer of this disclaimer, is that <br>
if you look at my code, you will find many places where I could've done "better" - meaning my code is not 100% efficient <br>
for performance purposes, not necessarily clean and clear, maybe even you'd find it messy. This leads me to my next point:

3. <b> You can make it better!</b> Don't just take my messy code victimized by deadlines and general amateurness. <br>
Many of my codes are built in ways that are a bit more wasteful than they would be if I had more time, meaning that <br>
sometimes maybe I use inheritance inefficiently, maybe I make too many references and instances, and maybe I use slow <br>
MonoBehaviour methods such as 'Find()' and its friends. You can do better. Invest time in understanding before you copy - <br>
<br> I had to learn this the hard way</b>. Copying a code when you don't properly understand the logics behind it will <br>
lead to later problems in adapting other people's codes and ideas to your project's needs.

4. <b> Finally, some technicall stuff instead of my ramblings</b>: 
  4.a. This project was made using Unity Editor (personal edition) versions 2017.1 to 2017.3.1f1.
  4.b. Everything here is written in C# (disregarding what little use I've made of coroutines which I have heard are C++).
  
If you've read up until this point, then thank you. Pat your own back for me. <br>
Have fun coding :).
